    "The pierhead and bulkhead lines are indicated in full red and broken red lines, respectively; or in full red lines alone where the two harbor lines coincide; and show within the limits of this map the latest recommendations of the Board up to this date. Where modifications in the harbor lines have been made the original lines are not shown; those shown have been approved by the Secretary of War. The bulkhead line defines the limit of solid filling, the pierhead line the limit to which open piled structures may be built."
