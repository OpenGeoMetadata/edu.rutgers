    "Unlike Japanese Americans, who were detained by the military, Japanese Peruvians were detained by the Justice Department. The Justice Department incarcerated Japanese Peruvians and other Latin Americans along with Germans and Italian aliens at Crystal City, Texas. The map shown here was drawn by an internee. Despite the seemingly suburban elements of the camp - the soccer field, the school, the community hall - note the armed guards and watchtowers on the perimeter of the camp."
