    "This map is based principally upon triangulation and traverse/surveys made by the U.S. Engineer Office, First District, N.Y., 1911-1913. Soundings refer to mean low water. Soundings given in feet and tenths are from U.S.E.D. surveys and in feet only from U.S.C. & G.S. Charts. The bulkhead line defines the limit for solid filling; the pierhead line, the limit to which open piled structures may be built."
