    "The combined pierhead and bulkhead line defines the limit to which solid fill or open pile structures may be built. No previous harbor lines have been approved over this area. This map is based on surveys made by the U.S. Engineer Department, Third New York District in 1917 and 1918. Soundings are in feet and refer to the plane of mean low water."
