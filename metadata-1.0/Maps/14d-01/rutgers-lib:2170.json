  "dc_description_s": "Colored and scaled geological map published in 1889 showing elevations, clays, names of existing geographic areas, delineation of land tracts, towns, boroughs, counties, and existing rairoad lines. Map has an inset of geological crust development over time in New Jersey. Includes locations of U.S. Coast Guard stations on the New Jersey Atlantic coastline as well as other manmade and natural landmarks. While assistant geologist of the state, 30 year Rutgers University Professor George H. Cook published three annual reports and a geological survey of Cape May County (1857). The office of State Geologist was vacant until 1864 when the legislature, through the efforts of Professor Cook, reorganized the department and appointed him New Jersey State Geologist. His annual reports and \"Geology of New Jersey\" (1868), together with a series of geological maps of the several counties of the state, certify to the wisdom of the act of the legislature. His investigations and reports on the clays of New Jersey and the flora of the state and his maps relating to geological formation and mineral deposits were used as models by the U.S. geological survey. This 1889 map was published the year of his death.",
