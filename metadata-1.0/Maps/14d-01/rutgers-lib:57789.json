  "dc_description_s": "The pierhead and bulkhead lines shown hereon are practically coincident with those shown on the Harbor Line Map for the same territory as approved by the Secretary of War, July 1, 1909, except the line between points 124 and 126 at Hackensack, south of Court street bridge, which conforms closely to the permit line of May 15, 1923, and line 155-157-159-161, modified August 31, 1927. |Revision of descriptive data heron is due to recent resurvey and the transformation of former magnetic bearings to true bearings.|The coordinates of points and bearings of lines refer to the rectangular system established by the Borough of Richmond, New York City, the principal axis of which is parallel with the true meridian through U.S.C. & G.S. Sta. ���Bogart��� on Todt Hill, Staten Island and the origin is so taken as to make the coordinates of ���Bogart��� S. 20350 ft. W. 20250 ft.|The shore lines and soundings are from maps of the 2nd N.Y. District Engineer Office.|Soundings are depths in feet at mean low water. |The street systems are compiled from assessment maps of the City of Hackensack, Borough of Bogota and Township of Teaneck.",
