Though the basic layers such as road centerlines, building footprints, hydrology and railroads were created by a consulting firm, much of the detailed attribute information was inputted by the Bureau of GIS. The back side of the map is also filled with useful Union County information. The Union County Parks System is highlighted with a thorough description of activities and facilities at all 29 parks including the 2,000 acre Watchung Reservation. The back side also includes Four Centuries Historical Sites information, municipal information, frequently called numbers within the various county departments and the Street Index, which was also generated through the Bureau of GIS.",
