The military believed that the West Coast, which contained the majority of Issei and Nisei residents, was the area most likely to be attacked by Japan. Executive Order 9066 relied on misplaced fears of Japanese American espionage to justify the incarceration of Issei and Nisei for \"security\" purposes.|The source for this map was \"Years of Infamy\" by Michi Weglyn.",
